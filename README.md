<h1>The purpose of this is to make it so whenever I talk something tells me to shut up.</h1>

<p>Yep, you read that right. I haven't made an actual video in a while, so I thought<br>what is something funny that I could do?</p>
<br>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<br>
<h3>SELF DEPRECATING HUMOR.</h3>
<br>
<p>So, this is the result of that. I made a vocal recognition neural network so I could tell myself to shut up</p>

<p>Isn't technology so dandy?</p>
